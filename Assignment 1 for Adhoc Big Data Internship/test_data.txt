Westeros is a big place with a long history and a cast of thousands. With
all the circumstances leading up to the events of the first novel and then
the War of the Five Kings, Narrators may find it daunting to run chronicles in this setting. This chapter serves to guide you through the process
of using the material in this book, and it is full of specific hints and tips to
help you bring Westeros to life. The chapter is in four sections.
The first two sections concern the look and feel of Westeros. The look
gives hints on how to make the scenery look like Westeros and make
the players feel that they are acting in Westeros, not a generic pseudomedieval world. The feel is concerned with the themes and motifs of
the books and ways in which you can incorporate them into your game.
A Song of Ice and Fire is not about heroes who kill dragons and rescue
princesses—it is much more complex, often epic in scope, and regularly
much darker than that. This section covers specific points you can incorporate into your games and practical problems you should be aware of.
The third section looks at ways to deal with player characters’ actions
that undermine the plot of the novels. The novels cover so much of
Westeros and encompass so many characters that it becomes hard to
isolate player actions. Even if you did, it would likely mean avoiding
the most distinctive places and characters, which are the very things
that drew the players to the setting in the first place. There are ways to
minimize this problem, and they are discussed here.
Finally, there are a number of concrete suggestions for adventures
and campaign structures, both to spark your imagination and to provide
some concrete examples of the principles discussed earlier.
The Look
The first task is to make your chronicle look like A Song of Ice and Fire
campaign, not a generic pseudo-medieval fantasy campaign or, indeed,
a historical medieval campaign. Westeros is, in general terms, a lot like
western medieval Europe. Magic is limited and generally subtle, and
there are no living dragons. A generic Westerosi village looks roughly
the same as a generic medieval village (with the exception that farmers
in Westeros grow maize). This means there are two main legs on which
your attempts to create the right impression should stand. The first is
avoiding details that do not feel medieval, and the second is using specific details from the novels. This section discusses specific ways to do
both of these.Westeros is a big place with a long history and a cast of thousands. With

both of these.to him than to the leader of the army as a whole. The Night’s Watch
is fundamentally divided between the garrisoned castles, and each garrison is of this scale.
This means there are very few organizations that span the whole of
Westeros. Indeed, the maesters of the Citadel and the septons of the
Faith are probably the only two, and in the case of the maesters, once an
acolyte forges his chain he’s bound to attend some noble in a far-flung
castle with little contact with his order. The Faith, however, is far larger.
There are thousands of septons, and they are all ultimately loyal to the
High Septon and the Faith as a whole.
There are many types of organizations. Merchants and craftsmen
form guilds, outlaws form bands, mercenaries form companies, nobles
form marriage alliances and join houses, and plotters form secret societies. Many diverse groups are mentioned in the books, and characters can
encounter members of them. While an encounter with a Faceless Man
is likely to go badly for the characters unless they can form an alliance
to deal with this threat, conflict with the Bloody Mummers might be on
more equal terms. And not every encounter should be combat oriented.
The characters can seek advice from maesters, befriend merchants, or
deal with the Alchemists’ Guild.
One advantage of using an organization mentioned in the books is
that none are given a full membership list, so there are clearly other members. This means the characters can have a definite Seven Kingdoms experience because they are talking to a maester wearing his chain, without
either having to ignore things that they know from the books or worry
about what will happen if they betray him and leave him to rot.
BuSINESSES
Much like organizations, businesses tend to be small scale. A craftsman runs a single workshop and sells his products from a room at
the front of his workplace. He most likely lives upstairs, and his apprentice sleeps under the workbench. A wealthy merchant might own
warehouses and shops in two or more towns, at the ends of his trade
routes, but middling merchants only own their premises in one town,
if that. Rented premises are very common, but again, landlords with
land in multiple towns are rare outside the nobility. It is common for
businesses to pass from parent to child; father to son is most common,
but the other combinations are not unusual enough to be worthy of
comment. If a business does not pass to a child, it almost invariably
passes to a former apprentice. Children are often apprenticed to their
parents and, thus, score on both counts. In the absence of a child or
apprentice, the business dies with the trader. There are very few companies with some sort of existence beyond the particular members,
and most of those are mercenary companies. Things are a little different on the eastern continent, but even there family businesses are the
rule, not the exception.
The businesses mentioned by name in the novels are almost all taverns or brothels because these are centers of travel and waypoints for
those journeying long distances. Taverns and brothels are often good
places for intrigue, business, and assassination. Taverns and brothels are,
helpfully, good places for people to meet and stories to start, and it
would be a shame to have the characters visit King’s Landing without
paying their respects at Chataya’s.
PLaCES
One of the two best ways to make your game look like the novels is to
take it to the places that are important in the novels. That means the
specific locations: not just a large castle but Winterfell or Harrenhal;
not just a city but King’s Landing or Oldtown. The places themselves
are described elsewhere in this book, and you can take further details
from the novels if you need them. This section discusses the practical
aspects of including places in your game—getting the characters there
and making them feel that they are in the location.
In some cases, you can base the characters in one of the books’ locations. If you are playing the Starks, for example, you are naturally based
at Winterfell. However, playing characters from the books is normally not a good idea, as the game can easily slide into arguments about
whether it is out of character for Arya to actually crack Sansa over the
head and drop her down the well, as opposed to just fantasizing about it.
Rather, the characters are likely to be members of a minor house that is
either your own creation or a very minor feature of the books, and their
home base will therefore also be your own. Thus, you have to move the
characters around to take them to established locations. As mentioned
above, travel is a major feature of the books and, thus, a good thing
to include. However, you need to give them reasons to travel. These
fall into two classes. The first arises from the background and gives the
characters a reason to travel to the place where a story will start. The
second arises from particular stories and gives the characters a reason to
travel to the next location. These categories are not absolutely distinct,
but they are still useful. Essentially, the reasons in the first class exist as
soon as you decide to run a game in Westeros, while those in the second
need to be set up specifically for your chronicle.
There are a number of reasons falling into the first class. The first,
and most common, is the need for bannermen to occasionally attend
on their lords. Thus, it is a good idea to attach the characters to a house
with a well-described seat; the Starks, the Arryns, and the Tullys are
all strong possibilities, but Stannis Baratheon, Balon Greyjoy, and even
Renly Baratheon should not be neglected. From this perspective, it is
best to avoid attaching the characters directly to the king because all
nobles have an occasional need to travel to the royal court in King’s
Landing. If their immediate liege is some lesser lord, the characters have
ready-made reasons to travel to two locations.
The second, almost as common as the first, is the existence of alliances of blood, marriage, and friendship between the noble houses in
an area. Nobles visit their friends, just as anyone else. Of course, in the
Seven Kingdoms, there are likely to be deeper and murkier motives as
well, but it is still a good reason to travel somewhere. So you should give
the characters links to other noble houses with seats that are at least
named and, ideally, described in passing. These links can also take the
characters out of their own area. The Seven Kingdoms are united, and it
is not impossible for a house in the North to be related by marriage to
one in the stormlands—or for it to seek such an alliance.
As mentioned in Chapter Two: Westeros Culture, tournaments are
very popular entertainment with the nobility, and a large tournament
can draw participants from across Westeros. A Dornishman would
probably need an additional reason to travel to a tournament at Winterfell, but a simple desire to participate could take him as far as Riverrun
without stretching plausibility.
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS

Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
While a noble’s duty to his liege requires him to attend his lord,
it might also require him to go elsewhere, serving his lord’s will. The
liege lord tells the characters to go somewhere, and go they must. It
might even be phrased as a request, but it is still impossible to refuse.
Westeros is not in a state of open war (yet), so these duties are normally
diplomatic, which is helpful. It tends to make for better stories if the
characters have the opportunity to talk before any fighting starts. Diplomacy does frequently go wrong, of course. Such a situation could
take the characters almost anywhere, even beyond Westeros. It is true
that the great houses are unlikely to send noble bannermen to Astapor,
but it is possible.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, travel is not a fast, reliable process on
Westeros. Once the characters are on the road, they are committed to
visiting other places in between, and difficulties on the journey might
send them a long way from their intended route. You could easily start
a campaign with the characters being sent to Astapor, and then run the
whole thing without leaving Westeros, as the characters get caught up
in events on their journey.
Most of these reasons can be overused. This is easiest with difficulties of travel. Players quickly become skeptical if they always encounter
storms, ruined bridges, and dangerous bandits. Similarly, while tournaments are common, they are not happening all the time. On the other
hand, if your campaign covers a significant amount of time, the characters would naturally be required to visit their liege on a number of occasions, and it would be natural for them to pay a number of visits to their
friends. The plausibility of their being sent on missions for their liege
depends on how well they do the first time; a striking success could well
lead to them being called upon again and again, while a notable failure
should make them very suspicious of any subsequent requests. The best
thing to do, then, is to mix and match them, and mix in reasons specific
to a single story.
That brings us to the second class of reasons. The most obvious way
that a story can send the characters to a particular place is by requiring
them to speak to a named person, who happens to be found there. This
could be the need to speak to a maester at the Citadel, or a maester
elsewhere renowned for his expertise. It could be a desire to find a bride
from a particular family, or even a particular noble daughter. There may
have been an insult, or misunderstanding, that may lead to war if not
mended with personal contact, and the insulted party is hardly going to
take the initiative and travel to meet the characters. This reason is a very
good one, as it can be combined with introducing a character from the
novels, and it also makes it clear what the characters should do when
they arrive at their destination.
The other obvious type of reason is the quest for a particular object.
In Westeros, this object is unlikely to be a ring that can control the
world and much more likely to be a family heirloom, such as a blade of
Valyrian steel that has been lost or stolen. This type of quest can also
work the other way around—the characters might have the object and
need to know where, or who, it came from. The first bit of the trail takes
them to a location, where they need to ask questions. A variation on
this is when the characters need to visit a particular place. They may be
searching for the children of the forest, for example, or simply wish to
pray at a particular sept.
Finally, the events of the story might make it imperative that the
characters leave their current location. Maybe a scheme fell apart, or
they were betrayed by their former allies. In this case, the characters
do not initially care where they are going, which makes it easy to guide
them to where you want them to go.
Once you have the characters at a location, you have to make them
feel like they are somewhere in the books. Simply saying, “You arrive
in Winterfell” is an important part of this, but it is not enough. If the
place just feels like a generic castle after they get there, the fact that
you (metaphorically) painted “Winterfell” on the walls will not help.
Description can help with this, but it is very easy to overdo it. Most
players do not want to sit and listen to your detailed word portrait of
a great castle—they want to play. A short build-up is likely to be most
effective. Describe the most striking features of the location, and finish
by naming it. Then, get on with playing.
The trick is to make play include distinctive features of the location.
For example, Winterfell is warmed by natural hot springs, which are
piped through the walls. If these springs are a central part of the events,
then the action is clearly happening at Winterfell, not elsewhere. This
does not mean describing the springs. It means having an important
object dropped into them, or an important fight happen around and
within them.
This, in fact, makes your job easier because you only need to pick
one feature, rather than trying to extract a comprehensive and correct
description from the novels. (And it should be noted Martin is deliberately vague on floor plans and the like, so the task is likely impossible.)
The secret tunnels in the Red Keep can be the setting for part of a
story without needing a full map, and while the characters are in the
tunnels, you do not need to worry about what the Tower of the Hand
looks like.

Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
It is important to pick a detail that your players will remember from
the books, and for that, you must know your players. Most readers are
likely to remember the tunnels in the Red Keep or the hot springs at
Winterfell, but they may not remember the details of where Arya ran to
before she found herself in those tunnels. Of course, your players may
know the entire series by heart, in which case you can rely on details as
subtle as you desire.
On a return visit to the same location, you should make another
feature central. So, the story of the second visit to Winterfell might
hinge on the double walls, or the poor state of repair of the Old Keep.
Therefore, you should choose somewhere central to the novels when
picking somewhere the characters will visit repeatedly; the more action
that happens there, the more details there are to build into a story. If you
always use the same detail, players will start wondering whether there
are any actual buildings in the Red Keep, or whether it is all tunnels.
Locations mentioned in passing are perfectly adequate for a single
visit. The Mormonts are from Bear Island, which is wooded and crossed
by streams. That is enough detail for one story. Something happens in
the woods, which requires crossing the streams, and the fact that it is an
island can confine people while there is a storm. For repeat visits, you
would have to develop the location beyond its description in the books,
however, so unless you particularly want to do so, it is best to write such
locations in as one-off trips.
This focus on details also helps to stop locations blurring into one
another. If the story involved a fight around a hot spring, the players
will be able to remember where it took place. “We fought him by the
hot springs, so we must have met him at Winterfell.” When the players
react to the reappearance of an old foe like this, you know that you have
brought the locations of Westeros to life.
PEoPLE
Finally comes the most important point. The novels are built around
their characters, and for players to feel they are in Westeros, their characters must meet those characters. They should not just get to see Jaime
Lannister from a distance, either. They should have chances to talk to
him, face him in a tourney, and even become friendly. This might lead
to problems where the events of the game make events in the novels impossible, but you should not avoid those issues by keeping your
player characters away from Martin’s. This topic is important, and a later
section discusses ways to deal with such complications. This section,
however, is concerned with ways to incorporate major characters into
your game.
The most important thing to remember is that the player characters are the central characters in your game. The characters from the
books should be significant supporting characters, but they must not
overshadow the player characters. The conflicts at the heart of your
adventures should be resolved by the player characters, not by Tyrion
Lannister. On the other hand, the characters from the books should be
important in the adventures, not just background color.
The easiest role is patron, and the most obvious kind of patron is liege
lord. Nobles have very good reasons to talk to their lord—and equally
good reasons to do as they are told. Powerful lords like Eddard Stark
also have good reasons not to micromanage their bannermen. Simply,
too much is going on for them to give detailed instructions on everything. Thus, the patron sets a task and certain conditions on achieving
it, and he expects a report afterwards. For the player characters, gaining
the patron’s favor is important, so the final report is a significant part of
the adventure, particularly if they were less than completely successful
in their task or violated the conditions.
While liege lords are the most obvious patrons, they are not the only
possibilities. Powerful figures are often restricted by their positions
and may need things done that violate those restrictions. Ser Barristan
Selmy might need agents who can deal with the underworld of King’s
Landing, and Lord Tywin Lannister always needs more dupes.
A related role is reward. A friendly encounter with a major character
from the books is a suitable reward for a successful adventure, which
makes the personal encounter more significant because it is clear not
just anyone is so honored. After the initial meeting, the character can
move to a new role: patron and contact are both obvious possibilities,
but given the complexities of Westerosi politics, a secret enemy is certainly not impossible.
For this to work, the encounter must be one that is not available to
just anyone. For most high nobles, any private audience that goes beyond
banal pleasantries falls into this category. Other characters may provide
more or less discrete rewards, however. Being intimate with Alayaya is
easy for anyone with money; getting her to confess the preferences of
her regular clients, on the other hand, is not. And that is information
that could be very useful in the politics of King’s Landing.
To give the players a sense of the importance of the reward it is a
good idea to have an encounter in which they do not get the sort of
audience they would like. You can even build this up over time for the
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
235
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
least accessible figures. For example, the first time the characters arrive
in King’s Landing, they have to crowd into the audience chamber with
everyone else. After a success, they are escorted in first, into a good
location. The next time, their names are announced, and the king acknowledges their presence. And so it continues until they are called to a
private audience with the king in the middle of the night.
The characters from the books can also serve as contacts who supply information to the player characters and guide them towards the
next step of the adventure. Knowing whom to ask is an important skill,
and none of the established characters knows everything, save perhaps
Varys. So it is relatively easy to make the information provided useful,
and the encounter important, without taking the possibility for action
away from the player characters.
It is often a good idea to avoid using established characters as the
primary rivals or enemies of the player characters. However, they can
become allies as long as they have good reasons not to provide too much
concrete help. One obvious way is to have the ally be distant. Tyrion
Lannister might be a close ally, but if the player characters hold lands
along the Wall, he will not be in a position to take direct action in most
adventures. Another possibility is for him to be busy, or have overriding
duties. Grand Maester Pycelle has many duties for the king and, thus,
cannot afford to spend a lot of time helping the characters, no matter
how much he likes them, while Benjen Stark cannot leave the Wall for
very long. Finally, the ally might have a lot of power—but of a type that
is not very relevant to the main concerns of the characters. The characters can be Howland Reed’s most favored friends, and he still can’t help
them much in the politics of the court at King’s Landing. If they ever
need to run to the Neck, however, they will find safe haven.
Allies have to help the characters sometimes, or they are hardly allies.
There are two main ways to make sure that this aid does not displace the
characters from center stage. First, make the characters earn the alliance
through play. If they have fought for it, the support they receive is due
to their actions, not just due to you pulling their fat out of the fire. If
past betrayals can come back to haunt them, then it’s only fair for past
loyalties to come back to save them, at least on occasion. Second, the
aid should not resolve the whole adventure. Rather, it should resolve a
major obstacle, leaving tasks that are within the characters’ capabilities.
The major characters can also be background scenery—characters
who appear in one scene and then pass out of the game again. This approach can be over-done, for example, if the characters meet a different
noble family every night as they travel down the kingsroad, but it can
also be neglected. If the characters are at court in King’s Landing, they
should bump into the Kingsguard, Varys, Petyr Baelish, and Jon Arryn
at various times. If they never quite manage to meet them, that itself
becomes strained.
Whatever role the book characters play, you need to introduce them.
In some cases, this introduction will be set up in the game’s background.
The characters’ liege lord, for example, is normally fixed before play begins. As play progresses, the connections between the nobility of Westeros will naturally draw other characters in. If the characters are sworn
to the Starks, it is natural for them to deal with the Tullys, the Arryns,
and the king himself. That, in turn, draws in the Lannisters, Littlefinger,
and anyone else in King’s Landing. Similarly, a maester is already linked
to the other maesters around him, and back to the Citadel. These connections do not feel forced.
On the other hand, you can probably get away with a chance encounter once in a campaign. A storm forces the characters to take shelter in
the same inn as Ser Jaime Lannister, who is very vague about why he
is not at court. They are visiting their liege when the Tyrells unexpectedly turn up, and they are seated next to Lady Olenna at the obligatory
feast. They bump into Littlefinger at Chataya’s. Done once, this can be
very effective, demonstrating that the course of history is not governed
by the plans of lords and ladies. Done repeatedly, it kills suspension of
disbelief.
Of course, once you have introduced the characters and given them
a role, you have to play them. Have them act in a way consistent with
their personality as portrayed in the novels. A kind-hearted, forgiving
Cersei will put the players instantly on their guard, and if she doesn’t
have a vile plot requiring her to dissemble, the players are likely to be
very disappointed. While this book gives thumbnail portraits of the
major characters, you will also need to rely on what you have gathered
from the novels.
The trick mentioned for places works well for people as well. In a
particular story, have one of the character’s notable foibles drive her
behavior. Cersei’s concern for Joffrey, Catelyn’s dislike for Jon, Brienne’s
infatuation with Renly. These can all be the main motivation for a particular action. As the character recurs, you should use other aspects of
her personality, so she gradually becomes more rounded. Even Martin
does this: Jaime is a much more rounded figure by the end of A Feast for
Crows than he is at the beginning of A Game of Thrones.
It is important to remember your Cersei will not be the same as
Martin’s. You are showing her in different situations—and before the
events of the novels have taken place. The players should also accept
your portrayal and not complain about inconsistencies with a couple of
sentences buried deep in one of the novels. This is a game, not a thesis least one player character should die in each chronicle arc, and at the
very least, you should do nothing to save them if they get themselves in
trouble. Striking player characters down in circumstances they cannot
reasonably predict or avoid would also be true to the books but should
probably be avoided in games. However, your players may not be happy
with the idea of their characters dying due to unnecessary misunderstandings, and you should respect that. There are plenty of ways to capture the feel of the books even without that element.
The rest of this section discusses more concrete aspects of the feel of
Westeros and ways to incorporate those aspects into your games. You
shouldn’t feel that you need to use every aspect in your campaign, and
you certainly don’t need to draw them all into every session. If a session
exemplifies two or three of these points, the feel will be there.
murKy moraLS
Westeros is not a world of black and white. There are no paragons of virtue and no black-hearted villains with absolutely no redeeming features.
Admittedly, there are characters who come quite close to being utter villains, but there are no characters without significant moral flaws. Even
the characters who come closest to being villains often act for reasons
that can be admired. They might act to support justice or out of love for
someone. Their lack of concern for the effects of their actions on everyone
else means they are still villainous, however. On the other side, the more
heroic characters sometimes commit murder out of petty spite.
This complexity should be reflected in the characters you and the
players create. The player characters are likely, in most cases, to be on
the more heroic side of the balance. If so, the player should think in
some detail about what makes the character heroic. Is it loyalty to his
family? Religious faith? A deep-seated sense of compassion? At least
two elements should be driving his virtue. The player should also think
about what could make the character act in an apparently evil way. A
threat to his family? Blasphemy? Deliberate cruelty? Finally, give him a
trivial virtue and a trivial vice, something like “kind to dogs” or “drinks
too much,” something that does not drive his whole character but which
could drive a single critical decision.
Some players might want to design characters on the other side of the
balance. In this case, you can simply invert the balance between forces
driving the character to evil and to good. Maybe the character hates another noble house and enjoys humiliating people. Or perhaps, he wants
to gather personal power and be treated as an equal by those who have
power already. Or he might love another person so much that he would
sacrifice anyone, even himself if absolutely necessary, for their sake.
When designing Narrator characters, you do not need to go into as
much detail because they might only be destined for a single scene. Recurring characters should be given this attention, however. In particular, you should consider making the main antagonist of the campaign
heroic but with strong reasons to oppose the player characters. Sitting
down and working out their differences is not possible, which makes the
player characters’ actions somewhat dubious.
You should also bear this point in mind in scenario design. One reason for requiring characters to have at least two motives driving their
virtue or vice is that you can then design adventures that put these in
conflict. What happens when honor and family pull in different directions? There should not be a right answer, though there may be wrong
ones. The best available choices should have significant downsides. A
similar technique is to create situations in which the morally right decision is not prudentially right. It might not be honorable to poison your
enemy at a banquet, but failing to do so might have truly disastrous
consequences, such as him poisoning your family, instead. If the characters are basically villainous, then put them in situations where the morally right choice is prudentially better, and if they curb their irrational
hatred of another family, they will do a lot better. Being purely good or
purely evil should be a poor strategy for success.
FamILy
Families are very important in Westeros. This does not mean that everyone lives in a happy family—though the Starks come close—before
everything starts. Rather, it means that everyone’s relations with their
relatives matter. Family matters, and intra-family relations are passionate.
More than that, family members are expected to be loyal to one another and to support one another, even if they do not like their siblings
or parents. This expectation is often fulfilled—families do work together, and members do not betray one another. Even if they fight among
themselves, they quickly unite against outsiders.
One benefit of this feature is that it provides an easy way to get the
player characters to work together; just make them all members of one
family. There might be tensions within the group, but there is a strong
reason for them to stay together. It also provides useful hooks to draw
the characters into adventures—they have a duty to support their family, and failing to do so has its own consequences. From a different perspective, if the main antagonist is a close relative of one or more player
characters, there are strong social pressures limiting just how directly
the characters can attack one another, which can broaden the range of
possible stories.
Finally, this expectation can collapse under extreme provocation, and
when it does, it is generally quite spectacular. Therefore, this can be a
good way to give more impact to the climactic events of a campaign.
The concrete uses of this feature are two-fold. First, all player characters
should have defined families and relationships with them. Second, these
relationships should sometimes be used to drive adventures. This does not
rule out characters who are the last survivors of a noble house otherwise
wiped out, but such characters should have strong feelings about their
dead relatives and what should be done to those responsible.
ta
NGLED PaStS
Characters in the novels have pasts with important events that both tie
them to other characters and to the history of Westeros. There are two
ways to handle this, and it is generally best to use both, as using either
alone has disadvantages.
The first method is defining the history of the characters when they
are created. The advantages of this are obvious, in that most characters
know what has happened to them. However, doing it in full detail can
take a long time and removes a certain level of flexibility from the
development of the game. The ideal, then, is to describe the general
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
237
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
outline of the character’s history: two or three important events and
at least two periods where he could have done significant things that
had no immediate impact. He might have been fostered in a distant
area, from which he could have traveled, for example, or spent a period
of time as a squire to a hedge knight. These can even overlap. An important event in the history of a female character, defined at character
creation, might be the three years she spent serving as a squire, disguised as a boy. That leaves space for specific things to happen during
those three years.
In the last thirty years, Westeros has seen the War of the Ninepenny
Kings, Robert’s Rebellion, and the Greyjoy Rebellion. Older characters
could have been personally involved in all of them, and all but the very
youngest should have been personally affected by the last two. History
does not pass people by in Westeros. At the very least, a family member
should have been captured and imprisoned for several years before being ransomed.
While designing the character’s history, both you and the player
should concentrate on events that can drive adventures and establish
tense relationships with other characters. Relationships can be tense
but positive—two characters who fought together against the Greyjoy
Rebellion, saving each others’ lives many times, are likely to be fiercely
loyal to each other even if one or the other is prone to foolish decisions.
Characters may have former lovers or have harbored unrequited love for
someone significant. They might have even killed someone important to
another family.
At this point, you want to make sure that past events link all of the
player characters together, and link them to the characters you intend
to use as antagonists. If you have a nexus or two that ties most of the
player characters to their opponents, that is all to the good. For example,
most of the player characters might have fought in one particular battle,
where they banded together, broke through the enemy lines, and killed
the lord before being captured. Then, they were exchanged for the lord’s
son and heir captured by their own side, who now passionately hates
them for killing his father. This history should also set up the initial
relationship between the player characters and their liege and establish
the other nobles with whom they are friendly. Ideally, you should know
what the first story arc involves at this point, and make sure that the
necessary links are established.
The second method is creating history as you need it, which is why
it is a good idea to leave space in the characters’ backgrounds. The characters may or may not be aware of these details. For example, a male
character in his thirties could have a teenage bastard who turns up suddenly in a later story. However, the characters should generally know
their own pasts, which means that you need to cooperate with them
when you want to introduce the event. Talk to the players involved, and
come to an agreement over what happened in one of the blanks in their
history. Then, in the next session, or maybe a little later, that bit of history comes back to haunt them.
SECrEtS
Characters in the novels have secrets. Giving concrete examples would
spoil the novels for those who have not read them yet, but those who
have read them can no doubt bring several to mind quite easily. These
secrets often shape their lives, driving them to do things that seem unreasonable to many of those around them. Since they cannot explain the
238
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
real reason for their actions, misunderstandings proliferate. Sometimes
the characters act to keep their secrets concealed. At other times, they
act because of what they know.
It is a good idea if most player characters have a secret. Having one
character in the group with no secret is not a problem, particularly if
everyone else is wondering what they are hiding. This secret should be
significant, in that it would cause significant complications if uncovered
and drive the character towards certain actions.
Suppose one of the characters is a girl disguised as a boy. In itself, this
is not really enough: the complications are likely to be minor and shortlived. However, she must be a particular girl disguised as a particular
boy. She could be a shopkeeper’s daughter who killed the son of a lord
after he raped her, and now the knight that boy served (another player
character) is helping to keep up the pretense that she is that boy…well,
that has a lot of potential. Similarly, the simple fact one character fathered a bastard is unlikely to cause problems. But if the mother was the
sister of the main antagonist, or his own sister, then there is rather more
potential for drama.
Secrets can involve a single player character, or they can link two or
more. The point of secrets is the characters know they have their own
secrets, so the involved characters should generally know. There are possible exceptions, however. One player character’s secret may be that he
killed another character’s father during a botched battle in the Greyjoy
Rebellion, when they were supposed to be on the same side. This works
best if the other character blames the antagonists and has sworn vengeance on their whole family.
This raises a meta-game consideration. The secrets of the various
player characters may or may not be known to the other players, regardless of what their characters know. Both choices are viable playing styles,
but it is best to get everyone to agree in advance. The advantage of keeping secrets from the players is that they can then enjoy being surprised
when the secret is revealed. The advantage of everyone knowing what is
going on is that the players can work together to give the secret a central
place in the story.
It is important to plan for the secret to be discovered at some point in
the game because, otherwise, you waste much of its potential. However,
this does mean that you need to be a little careful—some secrets could
bring the whole game crashing down if they were revealed. Sometimes
this only becomes apparent after a few sessions. In that case, change
the secret. No one knows what it is yet, so altering it to avoid ruining
everything is perfectly legitimate. Then, have it come out, so that you
don’t need to change it again.
SChEmES
Another feature of the novels is the existence of elaborate plots, spun
by any number of characters. Again, it is impossible to give examples
without spoiling the novels, but if you have read them, you know where
they are. Plotters are not necessarily good at it; there are some masters,
but there are also characters who get very much out of their depth.
One way to incorporate this is to have the Narrator characters catch
the player characters up in their schemes. This is a good idea, but it does
have problems. The main one is that, if the plotter is good, the player
characters might never find out that there was a scheme, which means
the players will also probably never know. This rather defeats the object of
the exercise. Thus, when you create a scheme to enmesh the players, you
should plan for the player characters to discover it, learn who was behind
it, and dismantle it. This process should require action on the part of the
player characters because a scheme that simply falls apart because the
plotter is incompetent does not create a sense of achievement.
However, it is far better to incorporate plots by having the player
characters create them. If they are the conspirators, they can enjoy the
deception even if no one else ever discovers what is going on. You have
two responsibilities here. The first is simple: encourage the players to
come up with elaborate plots to trap their enemies.
The second is a little more difficult. You should allow such plots to
work without making it completely trivial. There are a number of elements to this. First, you should allow Narrator characters to be deceived.
You know what the players’ plot is; your characters do not. Unless the
character has been consistently portrayed as highly suspicious, err on
the side of gullibility. Because you know the story being spun is false,
you are likely to judge it less plausible than it actually is.
Second, provide ways for the player characters to get their hooks
into other characters, so the plots can get started. These should be made
fairly obvious because, in general, the player characters do not know
they should be looking for them. Of course, if they do go looking for
blackmail material on a particular character, it probably exists.
Finally, be generous in your assessment of whether a plot works.
Players will not generally continue using a strategy that fails, and all
plots are complex enough for failure to be plausible. Thus, to encourage
this feature of the books, you should allow the players to be consistently
lucky, in that random chance does not bring their plots down. Of course,
failures in play by the characters can and should lead to the plot failing, and bad designs cannot be allowed to work, but a solid, interesting,
morally ambiguous plot should be given the random luck it needs to be
a success.
BEtrayaL
Betrayal is a major feature of the books. Indeed, there are few major plot
points that do not turn on a betrayal of some sort, and the characters
who have not, by the end of A Feast for Crows, been betrayed by someone can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Thus, betrayal should be
an important feature of your games as well.
However, betrayal needs to be handled carefully. Having a character betrayed is something that can easily spill over into real-world hurt
feelings, and capturing the mood in a game is not worth that. This is
most likely when the traitor is also a player character, but it can happen
when Narrator characters prove to be treacherous as well. This topic is,
therefore, good to discuss with the players before you start. You might
need to lay down ground rules as to which characters will not betray
the player characters. Perhaps their liege will not stoop to treachery.
This does not mean the liege is omniscient, so sometimes he will not
tell them important information because he does not know it. Similarly,
his plans might go wrong, leaving the characters in trouble. However,
he will never deliberately set the characters up to fail or lie to them
about his purposes. If the players want a trustworthy contact, you should
choose an appropriate character from the novels. For example, if they
want a liege who will never betray them, they should be sworn to the
Starks, not the Lannisters.
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
239
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
Even if the players are happy to be part of a more “realistic” game,
where they might be betrayed by any Narrator character, you should
give careful thought to forbidding betrayal of one player character by
another. Because even if the players are willing to sink to such Machiavellian depths, if the characters do not trust one another, it becomes
very difficult to get the group to stay together, which causes very real
practical problems in running the game. If you do want to allow occasional schemes and betrayals—because it really does fit the world
very well—then you could try ruling that betrayal of a player character
must not be premeditated, and the traitor must quickly come to regret
the betrayal and work to, somehow, restore the situation. Thus, a character captured and tortured, or one seduced and made drunk, might
betray the others, but he should soon start planning to make things
right again.
Player characters betraying Narrator characters cause no problems,
of course, other than possibly forcing you to think very quickly as a major scheme comes tumbling down. Narrator characters betraying each
other are no problem at all, as you can control both sides. Such betrayals
should be a major feature of the game, particularly if you feel that you
have to restrict the amount of treason directed at the player characters.
CruELty
Many inhabitants of Westeros are cruel, taking active steps to cause
pain and suffering to others. Even the more heroic characters often have
a cruel streak, though it may only surface under pressure. Accordingly, it
should be a part of your game, but it needs to be handled carefully. Cruel
characters quickly lose sympathy, so if a character is portrayed as cruel,
he is likely to be perceived as a villain. Still, a character with no cruelty
at all is probably too good for the world of Westeros.
Spontaneous cruelty against someone who has done the character a
great wrong generally causes little loss of sympathy. If a hero, on catching
the men who burned down his home with his family still inside, roasts
them all slowly in an iron pot, well, that’s cruel, but it is understandable.
It makes the hero somewhat tarnished, but it does not stop him from
being heroic, overall. If, on the other hand, he spends weeks and months
constructing a plot to make them suffer, then he is less sympathetic.
The more time a character spends planning to hurt someone, the more
repellent the cruelty becomes. The same applies if the hero roasts the
men who were actually responsible along with all the other members
of their band, including the women and children following the camp.
The more widely the cruelty spreads, the more heinous. Finally, there is
a question of proportionality. Roasting someone alive for laughing at
your new tunic is unspeakable cruelty, no matter how spontaneous or
narrowly focused it is.
Thus, the most repellent characters are those who are casually cruel,
planning to hurt someone, picking a victim at random, and doing it just
because it amuses them. There are such characters in Westeros, but you
are strongly advised to make them villains. Player characters, and allies,
should restrict their cruelty to spontaneous, and focused, responses to
outrages.
In portraying acts of cruelty, it is best to follow Martin’s style. He is
explicit but not graphic. That is, he tells the reader exactly what is going
on, but he does not describe it in gory detail. “He nailed her hand to
the table and sawed her fingers off one by one,” is at the borderline of
being graphic; any more detail should be avoided. On the other hand,
“He did really bad things to her,” might be too vague for the setting. The
characters should know what happened.
You should also keep an eye on the amount of cruelty in your games.
It is a significant feature of the books but not a constant one. If used too
often, it loses its impact and can make the game deeply unpleasant to
play in. Every incident of cruelty should be a significant moment in the
development of the story in the game; use nicer bits of Westerosi culture
for background color.
vENGEaNCE
Vengeance is a powerful motivator for people in Westeros. The Targaryen dynasty was brought down in revenge for the abduction of Lyanna Stark, as well as for the murder of the rebels and their fathers.
Vengeance is a simple element to include in a roleplaying game, with
no unusual risks or complications. Heroes and villains can both engage
in it, and players rarely object to their characters being the targets of
vengeance by others, particularly if it is justified.
It is, therefore, a good idea to have at least one character in a game
driven by vengeance. Fortunately, the players are likely to ensure such is
the case, putting some great wrong into their characters’ histories and
swearing vengeance against those responsible. If they don’t, you can suggest it. If they absolutely refuse to have any reason for vengeance in their
backgrounds, see if part of their background could give other characters
reason for vengeance. If the player characters have been in any battles,
such manipulation is easy to manage.
240
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
You should also pay attention to opportunities to seek vengeance that
arise in play. The antagonists should try to do bad things to the player
characters and their families, and if they succeed, the player characters
have a reason for vengeance. The reverse is also true; many successes by
the player characters simply plant the seeds of revenge.
The problem with cycles of vengeance is that they tend to grow and
become more violent, finally dragging a whole continent into a civil war.
Fortunately for us, this problem only afflicts the people who live there.
From the perspective of a game, it creates many more opportunities for
exciting play.
SEX
Sex, and sexual desire, are very important drives for a number of characters in the novels. While it is less prominent than vengeance or betrayal,
a game that ignores sex entirely is not really true to the feel of the books.
As with cruelty, try to avoid being too graphic.
Sex is generally called a mature topic. However, to be honest, if your
group can handle cruelty, betrayal, and vengeance within a game, they
are mature enough to handle sex without suffering any psychological
damage. A Song of Ice and Fire is not a series of children’s books, and
if you want to play the game with children, you should be planning to
change the tone wholesale, not just cut the sex.
The real problem with sex is it is notoriously difficult to include effectively in a roleplaying game. First, there are the embarrassing problems
of trying to play out a seduction scene between two characters when
the players have no interest in each other (and the even greater embarrassment problems when they do). Second, there is the problem that it
is very difficult to properly roleplay lust. Lust is an immensely strong
human drive. It makes people do amazingly stupid things. However,
no matter now many times you are told that the woman facing your
character is extremely attractive and clearly willing, it is easy to hold
on to the knowledge that sleeping with her would be an idiotic move.
Fortunately, in most cases the sex can be moved off stage. As in the
books, the relationship is what is important. Although the relationship
may be sexual, the actual act of sex is not a significant plot element.
Thus, you can finesse most of the problems by establishing there are
sexual relationships between characters, but keep those bits of the relationship off stage. Thus, you might indicate that two player characters
are lovers. That relationship then complicates other offers of marriage
and makes it important one not be caught in a brothel, but neither sex
nor seduction need happen onscreen.
Of course, if your players are happy to play out seduction scenes and
to let their characters’ desires get the better of their judgment, then you
can include those scenes in the game.
tarNIShED vICtorIES
The characters of A Song of Ice and Fire never get everything they want.
They win battles, even wars, but they always lose something important
in the process. It might be physical, so they defeat their enemies but also
destroy the castle so they cannot hold it. It might also be psychological;
they lose their honor or the trust of those around them. There are no
pure victories, and it is common for victories to be pyrrhic.
This is a very difficult topic for a roleplaying game. Traditionally, the
player characters in a roleplaying game have succeeded, at least in most
cases, and the Narrator has been warned against constantly setting them
up to fail. There is no reason, in principle, why players cannot enjoy playing
a character doomed to fail, but most players identify with their characters
to some extent and, thus, enjoy their successes and regret their failures.
The first step in implementing this feature, then, is making it clear
to the players that their characters will never have a pure success, and
if they do not like that idea, they should probably look at playing in a
different setting. Many dark games do allow the player characters to
triumph fully, even if they make it difficult, so the simple fact that A
Song of Ice and Fire is dark does not guarantee this.
The second step comes in story design. It is vital to avoid binary
success/fail adventures, and different levels of success and failure must
exist. Utter failure, with everyone dead, should generally be possible,
as discussed earlier, but there should be degrees of success, as well. In
particular, you should come up with at least two potential problems for
a victory, and design the adventure so the player characters can win with
both problems, or with only one, but not with neither. Ideally, competent characters should be able to choose to avoid one of the problems,
and they may or may not realize this guarantees them the other. If they
do realize, they must choose between them, making for excellent roleplaying. Most importantly, it leaves the players in control of their characters’ destiny. They might not be able to make things perfect, but they
can choose what goes wrong.
For example, the characters are allied to one house and opposed by
another, which is a little larger. The enemy house is about to attack them
because it believes the allies are too strong. The characters know their
allies are actually a lot weaker. If they betray their allies, they can attack
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
241
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
the enemies while they are distracted, but if they keep their allies’ secret,
they must face a stronger force alone, which guarantees death and destruction at their homes even if they can fend off the attack. Of course,
if they mess up the betrayal, they could end up facing both their former
enemies and former allies at once.
The third step comes in linking adventures. The problems with a victory should never just be simple tragedies. Rather, they should set up
and help to drive future adventures in the campaign. The books do include simple random tragedies, but players are generally more forgiving
if you avoid meaningless disaster. It is particularly good if the problem
with the victory is something that someone, whether the player characters or their opponents, can seek vengeance for.
ChILDrEN
Although A Song of Ice and Fire is not aimed at children, a significant
number of the viewpoint characters are children or adolescents. This
means that young player characters would be highly appropriate to the
feel of the books. However, you should think very, very carefully before
going down this route.
First, children are hard for adults to portray accurately. Martin has
admitted Bran’s chapters are the hardest of the books to write because
of the need to take an eight-year-old’s point of view. He has the chance
to write and rewrite, which is denied people in a roleplaying game.
There is no way around this; you simply have to judge whether you are
up to the challenge.
Second, children get no special treatment. Vengeance, betrayal, cruelty, and sex all target the young characters as much as the older ones.
Many people would be very uncomfortable with playing in a game in
which children were explicitly tortured or engaged in sex, even if the
graphic details were omitted. If any members of your group could not
cope with a thirteen-year-old enjoying a consensual sexual relationship,
or a ten-year-old being kidnapped and beaten, then you should avoid
young player characters.
Third, children have no history. A ten-year-old just has not lived long
enough to establish links to many people, making it harder to tie them
into the campaign. In this case, there are ways around it. Children have
parents and siblings, and those ties can be used to link them to other
peoples’ secrets, at least. The practice of fosterage can create broader
links and rivalries from a very early age. If you are happy with the first
two problems, then some thought can minimize the impact of this one.
However, it will be difficult to do this if more than one of the player
characters (two if you have a large group) are young.
None of these problems are insurmountable, and they are all easier
for characters Jon Snow’s age (fourteen) or older. However, you do need
to think about how you are going to handle them before allowing young
player characters into your game.
On the upside, A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying is designed to
accommodate younger characters with the Destiny system. Children
have more Destiny Points because of their greater unformed potential, which they can use to help survive the challenges adults use their
superior experience and abilities to overcome. Certainly some of the
child characters of the novels manage to survive against all odds,
moving towards their own destinies. Young characters in your own
chronicle can do the same.
Changing the Plot
There is a problem with running RPGs based on novels (or films)
that needs to be confronted head-on. What if the player characters do
something that derails the plot of the novels? They are then no longer
playing in the world of the novels because some of the most important
events are not happening. In some ways, Westeros is more forgiving
than many worlds in this respect. The Seven Kingdoms are, it soon
becomes obvious, rotten to the core and just waiting for some spark to
tip them into civil war. There is nothing the characters can realistically
do to prevent that war from happening, and if the war happens, the
factions are going to fall in a way resembling those in the novels. In
addition, there is no one central task that defines the world that, to be
faithful to the novels, has to be performed by an NPC; no ring that
needs dropped into a volcano. So you can have the player characters
do things without making them feel like bit players, and without completely derailing the novels.
In other ways, however, Westeros is a lot less forgiving. There are very
few corners where interactions with the nobility do not risk changing
things so the events portrayed in the novels could not realistically happen as described. True, if you set the campaign in Dorne, you’re fine until the events of A Storm of Swords, but then Dorne becomes a significant
setting for the novels as well, and you have to deal with it.
This problem is intensified by the need to have the player characters
interact with central characters from the novels. At the very least, important characters from the books are going to have allies and enemies
who do not feature in the official storyline.
The most important part of tackling this problem is to recognize in advance that it exists and to decide, as a group, how you want to handle it.
The group may decide that they just want to play in the world of A
Song of Ice and Fire. In fact, they’d quite like to play in a campaign where
they try to prevent the civil war, perhaps by having a player character
succeed Jon Arryn as the Hand of the King, thus leaving Ned Stark in
the North. In this case, you do not have a problem. The players want everything to turn out differently, so even if they almost certainly cannot
stop the war, they are not going to be upset if the war plays out in a very
different way from the original version.
However, your group may also want to play through the events of
the novels. This is entirely reasonable; there are some very dramatic moments in the books, and the desire to play a character who is there is
understandable. There are a number of possible approaches to this. The
easiest is to start the campaign just before that event. That is, run time
forward from the default starting date, and begin your campaign during
the war. The player characters might not begin with a close relationship
to any of the main novel characters, but they have an ideal chance to
finish that way.
Still, having mentioned the easy ways out, it is best to consider the
hardest case because it is also a perfectly sensible way to play the game,
and the techniques useful in it can also be used in easier cases. The hardest case is one in which the characters start some time before war breaks
out, want to interact with characters from the novels, and still want to
participate in many of the events in the novels.
It is important to realize it is impossible to have the events play out
exactly as they do in the novels. Apart from anything else, if the player
242
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
characters are involved, and not merely spectators, they must be able to
have an impact on the course of events, so even if the final result is the
same as in the books, the chain of events getting there will be different.
The best you can aim for is having a recognizable event play out with
some differences.
First, you and the players must recognize there are some characters
who cannot die before the novels start. Some characters cannot be replaced and still have things go on as before. If Cersei is assassinated, no
one can take her place, not even if Robert remarries. However, not all
significant characters fall into this group. Old Walder Frey plays a very
important role, but the role could be played by his heir. Even some of
the viewpoint characters are replaceable, with only minor differences to
their role in the story.
This should be reflected in your planning for adventures. The player
characters are unlikely to wake up one morning and suddenly decide to
assassinate the queen unless the adventure leads in that direction. So you
should not design adventures that lead in that direction. Rivalries with
characters who must survive should not be life-or-death rivalries; they
should be political, at worst. The books can survive the player characters
making nasty remarks about Cersei in private, after all. The best way to
manage this is to pick a central life-or-death rival who can die and keep
other characters peripheral. Doing so does not require you to divide the
whole cast into “dispensable” and “indispensable,” merely to find one or
two characters in the former category. A similar consideration applies to
allies of the characters; if the ally can be drawn into danger, make sure
that they are replaceable.
Another issue concerns the characters’ allies. If you play a political game, the characters might, by the time the novels start, be very
strong candidates for the position of the Hand of the King. Robert
will still go to his old friend Ned first, but the existence of the characters’ faction will change the balance of the subsequent politics quite
substantially. Again, the solution is to keep the campaign away from
the center. If the characters have risen to be the most influential bannermen of the Starks, things will shift but only slightly. The characters
are likely to be sent into a number of the events of the novels, which
is all to the good, but they will not be able to change whether most
events happen.
As mentioned above, secrets are a major feature of the novels. Player
characters who learn those secrets early could cause problems for the
plot. Again, you can design adventures that are not likely to uncover
those secrets. However, in this case, you can plan adventures that let
the characters uncover the secret, but leave them in no position to do
anything about it. They do not have enough evidence or political support to bring it into the open. Once the war starts, such a predicament
is likely to make them very useful to one or more factions, however,
so it should be handled with caution. They can also tell their allies
what they know, and their allies will take them seriously, so if your
characters are friendly with Tyrion, it is probably best for them not to
learn certain secrets.
To summarize, then, you should design the whole campaign so the
sensible outcomes do not derail the plot of the books. Since we are
assuming this is what the players also want, they will play along. If it
is entirely realistic for their characters not to cause trouble, they won’t
go out of their way to spoil things. This method involves setting events
on the periphery of politics, whether geographical or social. Intrigues
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
243
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
among minor courtiers in King’s Landing are just as far from changing things as power struggles in the riverlands. Choose a primary who
can be defeated without causing problems and close allies who can
safely die. If a character needs to be protected, make the connection
more distant.
Finally, in many cases, you have considerable discretion in deciding
on the wider impact of the characters’ acts. If you want to preserve the
plot of the novels, you can choose an impact that supports the novels.
While the Boltons of the Dreadfort could abandon the Starks in response to the rise of other bannermen, they are not forced to, and if
you want to preserve the events of the novels, they had better not. If the
players want you to keep the plot on track, then writing adventures to
avoid events that would obviously derail it will make them more forgiving if their actions do not happen to have possible consequences that
would cause problems.
Stories &
Chronicles
This section gives you some concrete ideas for stories and chronicles
set in Westeros. They are only ideas, not ready-to-run, and thus, they
serve in large part as examples of how to implement the general ideas
given above.
Story hooKS
These suggestions are primarily aimed at single stories, but some could
also be expanded into chronicles.
Court
The characters are sent to King’s Landing on a very specific mission—
they need to get a particular concession from the king, something not
inherently difficult to obtain if they can get a proper hearing from the
king himself. However, other courtiers, particularly rivals of the characters, know seeing the king almost guarantees success, so they do their
best to keep the characters running in circles and away from the throne.
DIPLomaCy
The characters’ liege sends them, and another of his bannermen, to negotiate a relatively minor issue with a major lord. The other lord wants
to handle the matter personally, but it is not important enough to
justify two great lords meeting, so he has agreed to deal with ambassadors. The negotiations should be fairly easy; several solutions would
be acceptable to both sides. The problem is the other bannerman has a
past entanglement with the player characters and is interested in making them look foolish. If the negotiations failed, and it looked like the
player characters’ fault, he would be pleased. He is trying to feed them
false information and get them involved in compromising activities.
If he can convince them the great lord is plotting to kill them, that
would be ideal.
FEaSt
The characters attend a feast with many courses and dancing. They are
required to be polite to the people around them. One takes an immediate romantic interest in a player character, an interest of which his or her
family would not approve. Another wants to goad the characters into
insulting him, so he can demand a duel (to first blood, he isn’t interested
in potentially dying), and make them look foolish. Still another drinks
too much and makes comments that could cause a lot of trouble if the
characters do not smooth things over. The characters can make friends
or enemies over the course of a single day, and everything they do is
very public.
KIDNaP
One of the characters has developed a romantic relationship with a
Narrator character, but marriage is impossible, most likely because of
prior arrangements but also, perhaps, because of the hostility between
their families. The characters decide (if necessary, under prompting
from the Narrator character) they have to be together, and the woman
runs away to join the man. The woman’s family treats this as kidnap. If
the player character is the woman, the other player characters have to
resolve the situation without denying it is kidnap because their family would be greatly shamed. If the player character is the man, all the
player characters have to deal with the “rescuers.” The couple does not
want to be broken up, so just handing the woman over is not really an
option. This is something of a no-win situation; success means avoiding
things going horribly wrong.
marrIaGE
The characters have to negotiate a marriage alliance, either for themselves or for a close relative. There are a number of sensible candidates
from other noble families, but none are perfect. Ideally, the character to
be married should have a lover, consummated or not, who would be a
politically difficult choice as a partner. The characters must be very tactful in their negotiations because breaking off a marriage after one side
thinks it is arranged is a grave insult and can make long-lasting enemies.
There is no right ending to this adventure. The characters just choose
which groups to turn into allies, and which to turn into enemies and, of
course, whether to make the person at the center of events happy or not.
PoISoN
The characters host some visitors and provide a feast. One of the visitors
collapses and dies of poison. The hosts are the obvious suspects and must
find the real criminal and solid evidence to avoid facing a lasting enmity.
The amount of time they have to do this, and the strength of evidence
they need, depends on their previous relationship with the guests; it is
easier to convince friends of your innocence. On the other hand, the
characters have a lot more to lose if the victims were previously friendly.
The poisoner could be an enemy of the guests who just decided to implicate the player characters, another member of the visiting family, or
an enemy of the characters trying to blacken their reputation.

ra
IDErS
Wildlings from beyond the Wall or ironmen from the Iron Islands arrive in the characters’ lands, raiding and burning villages. The characters
must catch and defeat them before they can get away with their booty.
This requires swift and decisive action, and the characters cannot assemble overwhelming force quickly enough. They must plan well and
are likely to lose a number of loyal retainers even if they succeed.
SErvaNt
A new servant is hired at the characters’ home. She is the sister of a
raider who was killed in a previous adventure and is here to get revenge.
She is not a skilled plotter, but she is not stupid, and she tries to stage
accidents, in the hope of eventually burning the whole castle down. If
there is enough of a distraction, she tries to kill the character who killed
her brother with a hidden dagger.
tourNamENt
The characters attend a tournament and participate. Their main rival
arrives, but soon after he withdraws from all the events on grounds
of illness. He stays in his pavilion, and the story is he hopes to be able
to participate before the end. In reality, he wants to see the characters
humiliated, and he devotes his efforts to sabotaging their chances. The
fact he is not participating makes it harder to demonstrate that he is
cheating and gives him much more time in which to do so.
war
The characters go to war, in a fairly small way. They might be sending
an expedition to support the Night’s Watch against the wildlings, or
tensions with another noble family might have finally got out of hand.
In the latter case, both sides need to fight it out without bringing the
attention of their lords down on them. So the actual war cannot go
beyond a single battle, after which they will publicly apologize and
make “peace,” with one side in a stronger position. The biggest problem for the characters is one of their allies plans to sell them out. They
might be able to find the traitor early, in which case they might just
be relatively weak in the battle, or they might have to deal with him
changing sides once battle has been joined, putting them in a very
dangerous position.
ChroNICLES
While the previous section concerned single stories, this section deals
with concepts for whole chronicles—groups of related stories. They
are designed to happen in the period before the events of the books
get started, so the background is one of relative peace across the Seven
Kingdoms. The scope of the campaigns is also finite, so you can finish
them before the books get going. Following that plan allows the players
to get comfortable with their characters and get the characters established in Westeros before they get involved in the great events of the
novels. Thus, the campaigns are also designed to not disrupt the plot of
the novels excessively.
rECLaImING thE BIrthrIGht
The characters have been deprived of their birthright by another minor house, and they must fight to get it back. The birthright in question must be something of great importance, and the obvious candidate is land. The other house has claimed the ancestral seat of the
player characters’ family and pushed the player characters onto a small
fraction of their former territory. However, the characters could have
retained most of their land, or even expanded in area, but lost control
of a castle with great historical importance. The lost birthright could
also be an inherited item, but it would have to be something like a
sword of Valyrian steel.
It is probably best if the player characters were deprived of the birthright fairly. If they have lost a lot of land, a recent ancestor might have
been a criminal and lost the lands as just punishment. Alternatively,
he might have been spendthrift and sold it. An item or single holding
might have been transferred as part of a marriage allowance the characters now regret, making the characters’ position morally ambiguous.
On the other hand, there should be some problem with the transfer, or
the characters seem like clear villains. A real-world example: the Elgin
marbles were taken from the Parthenon and exported to England with
the permission of the government of Greece at the time. However, at
that point, Greece was ruled by the Turks. Thus, both the Greeks and
the English can claim to be the rightful owners.
The conflict cannot be solved through simple violence because the
initial legal situation is against the player characters. Even if they can
take their birthright by force, other nobles will compel them to give it
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
245
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
back, and they may lose what little they have left (if not actually losing
their lives). This predicament is obvious to the characters and should be
made clear to the players.
The campaign relies on the player characters taking the initiative—
the people who hold their birthright are happy with the status quo,
after all. They can undermine the rivals’ hold on their birthright in a
number of ways. They can pursue legal channels, which could involve
bribery, intimidation, and the improvement of evidence. They can undermine the rivals’ position, making them look like traitors, weakening
them through raids blamed on someone else, or faking evidence that
makes them look like aggressors. They can also try simply provoking
their rivals into starting a war, so that the characters might be allowed
to keep any gains.
No matter how things are set up, the final contest is almost certain to
be military, as the rivals will not give up something so valuable without
a fight.
a FathEr’S BLESSING
The player characters are all siblings, and their father is the lord. However, he thinks the player characters are all unreliable failures, and he
puts all his hopes and trust in their brother. Their brother is a nasty
piece of work, though their father does not see it; the brother is too
clever to present his father with incontrovertible evidence. Some of the
player characters’ failures may be genuine, but others may have been
constructed by their scheming brother.
The player characters are at risk of being disinherited, so they must
expose their brother for the villain that he is and convince their father
that they are trustworthy. The brother, meanwhile, is using his influence to make life difficult for them while feigning love and support
in front of father. If the characters move openly against their brother,
they will look the treacherous ones. On the other hand, if the player
characters cannot do something to convince their father that they are
competent, they are unlikely to benefit even if they do unmask their
brother.
This campaign is inherently tangled because the main rival is part
of the family. An added complication is the fact that only one player
character can be made the heir, which might divide the player characters if they come close to success. However, you can affect the tone
by changing the character of the brother. At one extreme, he might
be a bastard, barely known to the characters’ father—and thoroughly
evil and treacherous. This puts the player characters in the right. At
the other extreme, he might just be very ambitious, dislike the player
characters because they used to pick on him, and not have lied about
any of their mistakes; he just put the worst possible light on things.
In this case, the player characters might even be able to reconcile with
their brother, though the events of the campaign are likely to make
that difficult.
A good way to end this campaign is for the characters’ father to die,
and the heir take over the holding. If the heir is the brother, the player
characters are out on their ears, just in time to get involved in a war. If
the heir is a player character, he becomes a bannerman, just in time to
get involved in a war.
wILDLINGS
This campaign concept is a simple one. The characters hold land in the
North, near the Wall, and suffer from wildling raids. Adventures would
involve fighting off raiders, tracking them back across the Wall, trying
to destroy their encampments, and possibly stumbling on to the scale
of Mance Rayder’s plans. The characters are closely involved with the
Night’s Watch, but even though they are on the same side, relations are
tense, for they are also using the same resources. The characters may also
encounter wights and the Others, as long as they do not have clear proof
or lots of witnesses. As long as wights and monsters beyond the Wall
can be dismissed as stories, the plot of the novels can unfold.
Since the characters are in the North, they are bannermen to the
Starks. Their problems with wildlings keep them away from Winterfell
most of the time, but building a good relationship with Eddard Stark,
and possibly with his children, would set them up for involvement in
the coming great events. As Eddard takes his responsibilities seriously,
he might well come in person to help the characters against a particularly large raiding band, and Benjen Stark, as First Ranger, would also
be expected to have some contact with them.
As long as the player characters are not able to kill Mance Rayder, or
other named wildlings, this campaign is unlikely to disrupt the books.
There are numerous wildlings north of the Wall, after all.
BLooD For BLooD
The characters’ home did not fare well in one of the recent wars. The
castle was sacked and largely destroyed, family members were killed and
possibly raped, and the smallfolk pillaged. The characters were on the
winning side, however, so they got their lands back, in ruins. But the
people responsible for sacking it were not punished nearly so severely.
They continue to enjoy the prosperity of their lands and holding.
This campaign is about vengeance. The characters, at least to start
with, want to see their enemies dead and their castle cast down. The
problem is the king, and most of the high nobles, want the last war to be
over, and do not look kindly on families who stir up trouble again. Thus,
the player characters must rely on schemes that hide their involvement,
or that trap their enemies into offending enough people that they can
be attacked with impunity. In the classic style, the characters do not
want their enemies to perish at anyone else’s hands, so they aim simply
to keep everyone else out of the argument.
To complicate matters, have a significant member of the enemy family be genuinely repentant, making efforts to compensate the player
characters and rebuild good relations. Of course, he (or she) is not willing to sell his own family out, but he is willing to make real sacrifices
because he thinks his family really was wrong. The player characters will
doubtless assume some devious plot. To make things complex in a different way, it could actually be a devious plot.
The campaign ends with either successful vengeance or, much less
probably, with peace between the families. Vengeance begets vengeance,
of course, and the characters’ enemies will have the advantage that the
outbreak of civil war allows them to act much more directly.

very least, you should do nothing to save them if they get themselves in
trouble. Striking player characters down in circumstances they cannot
reasonably predict or avoid would also be true to the books but should
probably be avoided in games. However, your players may not be happy
with the idea of their characters dying due to unnecessary misunderstandings, and you should respect that. There are plenty of ways to capture the feel of the books even without that element.
The rest of this section discusses more concrete aspects of the feel of
Westeros and ways to incorporate those aspects into your games. You
shouldn’t feel that you need to use every aspect in your campaign, and
you certainly don’t need to draw them all into every session. If a session
exemplifies two or three of these points, the feel will be there.
murKy moraLS
Westeros is not a world of black and white. There are no paragons of virtue and no black-hearted villains with absolutely no redeeming features.
Admittedly, there are characters who come quite close to being utter villains, but there are no characters without significant moral flaws. Even
the characters who come closest to being villains often act for reasons
that can be admired. They might act to support justice or out of love for
someone. Their lack of concern for the effects of their actions on everyone
else means they are still villainous, however. On the other side, the more
heroic characters sometimes commit murder out of petty spite.
This complexity should be reflected in the characters you and the
players create. The player characters are likely, in most cases, to be on
the more heroic side of the balance. If so, the player should think in
some detail about what makes the character heroic. Is it loyalty to his
family? Religious faith? A deep-seated sense of compassion? At least
two elements should be driving his virtue. The player should also think
about what could make the character act in an apparently evil way. A
threat to his family? Blasphemy? Deliberate cruelty? Finally, give him a
trivial virtue and a trivial vice, something like “kind to dogs” or “drinks
too much,” something that does not drive his whole character but which
could drive a single critical decision.
Some players might want to design characters on the other side of the
balance. In this case, you can simply invert the balance between forces
driving the character to evil and to good. Maybe the character hates another noble house and enjoys humiliating people. Or perhaps, he wants
to gather personal power and be treated as an equal by those who have
power already. Or he might love another person so much that he would
sacrifice anyone, even himself if absolutely necessary, for their sake.
When designing Narrator characters, you do not need to go into as
much detail because they might only be destined for a single scene. Recurring characters should be given this attention, however. In particular, you should consider making the main antagonist of the campaign
heroic but with strong reasons to oppose the player characters. Sitting
down and working out their differences is not possible, which makes the
player characters’ actions somewhat dubious.
You should also bear this point in mind in scenario design. One reason for requiring characters to have at least two motives driving their
virtue or vice is that you can then design adventures that put these in
conflict. What happens when honor and family pull in different directions? There should not be a right answer, though there may be wrong
ones. The best available choices should have significant downsides. A
similar technique is to create situations in which the morally right decision is not prudentially right. It might not be honorable to poison your
enemy at a banquet, but failing to do so might have truly disastrous
consequences, such as him poisoning your family, instead. If the characters are basically villainous, then put them in situations where the morally right choice is prudentially better, and if they curb their irrational
hatred of another family, they will do a lot better. Being purely good or
purely evil should be a poor strategy for success.
FamILy
Families are very important in Westeros. This does not mean that everyone lives in a happy family—though the Starks come close—before
everything starts. Rather, it means that everyone’s relations with their
relatives matter. Family matters, and intra-family relations are passionate.
More than that, family members are expected to be loyal to one another and to support one another, even if they do not like their siblings
or parents. This expectation is often fulfilled—families do work together, and members do not betray one another. Even if they fight among
themselves, they quickly unite against outsiders.
One benefit of this feature is that it provides an easy way to get the
player characters to work together; just make them all members of one
family. There might be tensions within the group, but there is a strong
reason for them to stay together. It also provides useful hooks to draw
the characters into adventures—they have a duty to support their family, and failing to do so has its own consequences. From a different perspective, if the main antagonist is a close relative of one or more player
characters, there are strong social pressures limiting just how directly
the characters can attack one another, which can broaden the range of
possible stories.
Finally, this expectation can collapse under extreme provocation, and
when it does, it is generally quite spectacular. Therefore, this can be a
good way to give more impact to the climactic events of a campaign.
The concrete uses of this feature are two-fold. First, all player characters
should have defined families and relationships with them. Second, these
relationships should sometimes be used to drive adventures. This does not
rule out characters who are the last survivors of a noble house otherwise
wiped out, but such characters should have strong feelings about their
dead relatives and what should be done to those responsible.
ta
NGLED PaStS
Characters in the novels have pasts with important events that both tie
them to other characters and to the history of Westeros. There are two
ways to handle this, and it is generally best to use both, as using either
alone has disadvantages.
The first method is defining the history of the characters when they
are created. The advantages of this are obvious, in that most characters
know what has happened to them. However, doing it in full detail can
take a long time and removes a certain level of flexibility from the
development of the game. The ideal, then, is to describe the general
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
237
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
outline of the character’s history: two or three important events and
at least two periods where he could have done significant things that
had no immediate impact. He might have been fostered in a distant
area, from which he could have traveled, for example, or spent a period
of time as a squire to a hedge knight. These can even overlap. An important event in the history of a female character, defined at character
creation, might be the three years she spent serving as a squire, disguised as a boy. That leaves space for specific things to happen during
those three years.
In the last thirty years, Westeros has seen the War of the Ninepenny
Kings, Robert’s Rebellion, and the Greyjoy Rebellion. Older characters
could have been personally involved in all of them, and all but the very
youngest should have been personally affected by the last two. History
does not pass people by in Westeros. At the very least, a family member
should have been captured and imprisoned for several years before being ransomed.
While designing the character’s history, both you and the player
should concentrate on events that can drive adventures and establish
tense relationships with other characters. Relationships can be tense
but positive—two characters who fought together against the Greyjoy
Rebellion, saving each others’ lives many times, are likely to be fiercely
loyal to each other even if one or the other is prone to foolish decisions.
Characters may have former lovers or have harbored unrequited love for
someone significant. They might have even killed someone important to
another family.
At this point, you want to make sure that past events link all of the
player characters together, and link them to the characters you intend
to use as antagonists. If you have a nexus or two that ties most of the
player characters to their opponents, that is all to the good. For example,
most of the player characters might have fought in one particular battle,
where they banded together, broke through the enemy lines, and killed
the lord before being captured. Then, they were exchanged for the lord’s
son and heir captured by their own side, who now passionately hates
them for killing his father. This history should also set up the initial
relationship between the player characters and their liege and establish
the other nobles with whom they are friendly. Ideally, you should know
what the first story arc involves at this point, and make sure that the
necessary links are established.
The second method is creating history as you need it, which is why
it is a good idea to leave space in the characters’ backgrounds. The characters may or may not be aware of these details. For example, a male
character in his thirties could have a teenage bastard who turns up suddenly in a later story. However, the characters should generally know
their own pasts, which means that you need to cooperate with them
when you want to introduce the event. Talk to the players involved, and
come to an agreement over what happened in one of the blanks in their
history. Then, in the next session, or maybe a little later, that bit of history comes back to haunt them.
SECrEtS
Characters in the novels have secrets. Giving concrete examples would
spoil the novels for those who have not read them yet, but those who
have read them can no doubt bring several to mind quite easily. These
secrets often shape their lives, driving them to do things that seem unreasonable to many of those around them. Since they cannot explain the
238
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
real reason for their actions, misunderstandings proliferate. Sometimes
the characters act to keep their secrets concealed. At other times, they
act because of what they know.
It is a good idea if most player characters have a secret. Having one
character in the group with no secret is not a problem, particularly if
everyone else is wondering what they are hiding. This secret should be
significant, in that it would cause significant complications if uncovered
and drive the character towards certain actions.
Suppose one of the characters is a girl disguised as a boy. In itself, this
is not really enough: the complications are likely to be minor and shortlived. However, she must be a particular girl disguised as a particular
boy. She could be a shopkeeper’s daughter who killed the son of a lord
after he raped her, and now the knight that boy served (another player
character) is helping to keep up the pretense that she is that boy…well,
that has a lot of potential. Similarly, the simple fact one character fathered a bastard is unlikely to cause problems. But if the mother was the
sister of the main antagonist, or his own sister, then there is rather more
potential for drama.
Secrets can involve a single player character, or they can link two or
more. The point of secrets is the characters know they have their own
secrets, so the involved characters should generally know. There are possible exceptions, however. One player character’s secret may be that he
killed another character’s father during a botched battle in the Greyjoy
Rebellion, when they were supposed to be on the same side. This works
best if the other character blames the antagonists and has sworn vengeance on their whole family.
This raises a meta-game consideration. The secrets of the various
player characters may or may not be known to the other players, regardless of what their characters know. Both choices are viable playing styles,
but it is best to get everyone to agree in advance. The advantage of keeping secrets from the players is that they can then enjoy being surprised
when the secret is revealed. The advantage of everyone knowing what is
going on is that the players can work together to give the secret a central
place in the story.
It is important to plan for the secret to be discovered at some point in
the game because, otherwise, you waste much of its potential. However,
this does mean that you need to be a little careful—some secrets could
bring the whole game crashing down if they were revealed. Sometimes
this only becomes apparent after a few sessions. In that case, change
the secret. No one knows what it is yet, so altering it to avoid ruining
everything is perfectly legitimate. Then, have it come out, so that you
don’t need to change it again.
SChEmES
Another feature of the novels is the existence of elaborate plots, spun
by any number of characters. Again, it is impossible to give examples
without spoiling the novels, but if you have read them, you know where
they are. Plotters are not necessarily good at it; there are some masters,
but there are also characters who get very much out of their depth.
One way to incorporate this is to have the Narrator characters catch
the player characters up in their schemes. This is a good idea, but it does
have problems. The main one is that, if the plotter is good, the player
characters might never find out that there was a scheme, which means
the players will also probably never know. This rather defeats the object of
the exercise. Thus, when you create a scheme to enmesh the players, you
should plan for the player characters to discover it, learn who was behind
it, and dismantle it. This process should require action on the part of the
player characters because a scheme that simply falls apart because the
plotter is incompetent does not create a sense of achievement.
However, it is far better to incorporate plots by having the player
characters create them. If they are the conspirators, they can enjoy the
deception even if no one else ever discovers what is going on. You have
two responsibilities here. The first is simple: encourage the players to
come up with elaborate plots to trap their enemies.
The second is a little more difficult. You should allow such plots to
work without making it completely trivial. There are a number of elements to this. First, you should allow Narrator characters to be deceived.
You know what the players’ plot is; your characters do not. Unless the
character has been consistently portrayed as highly suspicious, err on
the side of gullibility. Because you know the story being spun is false,
you are likely to judge it less plausible than it actually is.
Second, provide ways for the player characters to get their hooks
into other characters, so the plots can get started. These should be made
fairly obvious because, in general, the player characters do not know
they should be looking for them. Of course, if they do go looking for
blackmail material on a particular character, it probably exists.
Finally, be generous in your assessment of whether a plot works.
Players will not generally continue using a strategy that fails, and all
plots are complex enough for failure to be plausible. Thus, to encourage
this feature of the books, you should allow the players to be consistently
lucky, in that random chance does not bring their plots down. Of course,
failures in play by the characters can and should lead to the plot failing, and bad designs cannot be allowed to work, but a solid, interesting,
morally ambiguous plot should be given the random luck it needs to be
a success.
BEtrayaL
Betrayal is a major feature of the books. Indeed, there are few major plot
points that do not turn on a betrayal of some sort, and the characters
who have not, by the end of A Feast for Crows, been betrayed by someone can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Thus, betrayal should be
an important feature of your games as well.
However, betrayal needs to be handled carefully. Having a character betrayed is something that can easily spill over into real-world hurt
feelings, and capturing the mood in a game is not worth that. This is
most likely when the traitor is also a player character, but it can happen
when Narrator characters prove to be treacherous as well. This topic is,
therefore, good to discuss with the players before you start. You might
need to lay down ground rules as to which characters will not betray
the player characters. Perhaps their liege will not stoop to treachery.
This does not mean the liege is omniscient, so sometimes he will not
tell them important information because he does not know it. Similarly,
his plans might go wrong, leaving the characters in trouble. However,
he will never deliberately set the characters up to fail or lie to them
about his purposes. If the players want a trustworthy contact, you should
choose an appropriate character from the novels. For example, if they
want a liege who will never betray them, they should be sworn to the
Starks, not the Lannisters.
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
239
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
Even if the players are happy to be part of a more “realistic” game,
where they might be betrayed by any Narrator character, you should
give careful thought to forbidding betrayal of one player character by
another. Because even if the players are willing to sink to such Machiavellian depths, if the characters do not trust one another, it becomes
very difficult to get the group to stay together, which causes very real
practical problems in running the game. If you do want to allow occasional schemes and betrayals—because it really does fit the world
very well—then you could try ruling that betrayal of a player character
must not be premeditated, and the traitor must quickly come to regret
the betrayal and work to, somehow, restore the situation. Thus, a character captured and tortured, or one seduced and made drunk, might
betray the others, but he should soon start planning to make things
right again.
Player characters betraying Narrator characters cause no problems,
of course, other than possibly forcing you to think very quickly as a major scheme comes tumbling down. Narrator characters betraying each
other are no problem at all, as you can control both sides. Such betrayals
should be a major feature of the game, particularly if you feel that you
have to restrict the amount of treason directed at the player characters.
CruELty
Many inhabitants of Westeros are cruel, taking active steps to cause
pain and suffering to others. Even the more heroic characters often have
a cruel streak, though it may only surface under pressure. Accordingly, it
should be a part of your game, but it needs to be handled carefully. Cruel
characters quickly lose sympathy, so if a character is portrayed as cruel,
he is likely to be perceived as a villain. Still, a character with no cruelty
at all is probably too good for the world of Westeros.
Spontaneous cruelty against someone who has done the character a
great wrong generally causes little loss of sympathy. If a hero, on catching
the men who burned down his home with his family still inside, roasts
them all slowly in an iron pot, well, that’s cruel, but it is understandable.
It makes the hero somewhat tarnished, but it does not stop him from
being heroic, overall. If, on the other hand, he spends weeks and months
constructing a plot to make them suffer, then he is less sympathetic.
The more time a character spends planning to hurt someone, the more
repellent the cruelty becomes. The same applies if the hero roasts the
men who were actually responsible along with all the other members
of their band, including the women and children following the camp.
The more widely the cruelty spreads, the more heinous. Finally, there is
a question of proportionality. Roasting someone alive for laughing at
your new tunic is unspeakable cruelty, no matter how spontaneous or
narrowly focused it is.
Thus, the most repellent characters are those who are casually cruel,
planning to hurt someone, picking a victim at random, and doing it just
because it amuses them. There are such characters in Westeros, but you
are strongly advised to make them villains. Player characters, and allies,
should restrict their cruelty to spontaneous, and focused, responses to
outrages.
In portraying acts of cruelty, it is best to follow Martin’s style. He is
explicit but not graphic. That is, he tells the reader exactly what is going
on, but he does not describe it in gory detail. “He nailed her hand to
the table and sawed her fingers off one by one,” is at the borderline of
being graphic; any more detail should be avoided. On the other hand,
“He did really bad things to her,” might be too vague for the setting. The
characters should know what happened.
You should also keep an eye on the amount of cruelty in your games.
It is a significant feature of the books but not a constant one. If used too
often, it loses its impact and can make the game deeply unpleasant to
play in. Every incident of cruelty should be a significant moment in the
development of the story in the game; use nicer bits of Westerosi culture
for background color.
vENGEaNCE
Vengeance is a powerful motivator for people in Westeros. The Targaryen dynasty was brought down in revenge for the abduction of Lyanna Stark, as well as for the murder of the rebels and their fathers.
Vengeance is a simple element to include in a roleplaying game, with
no unusual risks or complications. Heroes and villains can both engage
in it, and players rarely object to their characters being the targets of
vengeance by others, particularly if it is justified.
It is, therefore, a good idea to have at least one character in a game
driven by vengeance. Fortunately, the players are likely to ensure such is
the case, putting some great wrong into their characters’ histories and
swearing vengeance against those responsible. If they don’t, you can suggest it. If they absolutely refuse to have any reason for vengeance in their
backgrounds, see if part of their background could give other characters
reason for vengeance. If the player characters have been in any battles,
such manipulation is easy to manage.
240
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
You should also pay attention to opportunities to seek vengeance that
arise in play. The antagonists should try to do bad things to the player
characters and their families, and if they succeed, the player characters
have a reason for vengeance. The reverse is also true; many successes by
the player characters simply plant the seeds of revenge.
The problem with cycles of vengeance is that they tend to grow and
become more violent, finally dragging a whole continent into a civil war.
Fortunately for us, this problem only afflicts the people who live there.
From the perspective of a game, it creates many more opportunities for
exciting play.
SEX
Sex, and sexual desire, are very important drives for a number of characters in the novels. While it is less prominent than vengeance or betrayal,
a game that ignores sex entirely is not really true to the feel of the books.
As with cruelty, try to avoid being too graphic.
Sex is generally called a mature topic. However, to be honest, if your
group can handle cruelty, betrayal, and vengeance within a game, they
are mature enough to handle sex without suffering any psychological
damage. A Song of Ice and Fire is not a series of children’s books, and
if you want to play the game with children, you should be planning to
change the tone wholesale, not just cut the sex.
The real problem with sex is it is notoriously difficult to include effectively in a roleplaying game. First, there are the embarrassing problems
of trying to play out a seduction scene between two characters when
the players have no interest in each other (and the even greater embarrassment problems when they do). Second, there is the problem that it
is very difficult to properly roleplay lust. Lust is an immensely strong
human drive. It makes people do amazingly stupid things. However,
no matter now many times you are told that the woman facing your
character is extremely attractive and clearly willing, it is easy to hold
on to the knowledge that sleeping with her would be an idiotic move.
Fortunately, in most cases the sex can be moved off stage. As in the
books, the relationship is what is important. Although the relationship
may be sexual, the actual act of sex is not a significant plot element.
Thus, you can finesse most of the problems by establishing there are
sexual relationships between characters, but keep those bits of the relationship off stage. Thus, you might indicate that two player characters
are lovers. That relationship then complicates other offers of marriage
and makes it important one not be caught in a brothel, but neither sex
nor seduction need happen onscreen.
Of course, if your players are happy to play out seduction scenes and
to let their characters’ desires get the better of their judgment, then you
can include those scenes in the game.
tarNIShED vICtorIES
The characters of A Song of Ice and Fire never get everything they want.
They win battles, even wars, but they always lose something important
in the process. It might be physical, so they defeat their enemies but also
destroy the castle so they cannot hold it. It might also be psychological;
they lose their honor or the trust of those around them. There are no
pure victories, and it is common for victories to be pyrrhic.
This is a very difficult topic for a roleplaying game. Traditionally, the
player characters in a roleplaying game have succeeded, at least in most
cases, and the Narrator has been warned against constantly setting them
up to fail. There is no reason, in principle, why players cannot enjoy playing
a character doomed to fail, but most players identify with their characters
to some extent and, thus, enjoy their successes and regret their failures.
The first step in implementing this feature, then, is making it clear
to the players that their characters will never have a pure success, and
if they do not like that idea, they should probably look at playing in a
different setting. Many dark games do allow the player characters to
triumph fully, even if they make it difficult, so the simple fact that A
Song of Ice and Fire is dark does not guarantee this.
The second step comes in story design. It is vital to avoid binary
success/fail adventures, and different levels of success and failure must
exist. Utter failure, with everyone dead, should generally be possible,
as discussed earlier, but there should be degrees of success, as well. In
particular, you should come up with at least two potential problems for
a victory, and design the adventure so the player characters can win with
both problems, or with only one, but not with neither. Ideally, competent characters should be able to choose to avoid one of the problems,
and they may or may not realize this guarantees them the other. If they
do realize, they must choose between them, making for excellent roleplaying. Most importantly, it leaves the players in control of their characters’ destiny. They might not be able to make things perfect, but they
can choose what goes wrong.
For example, the characters are allied to one house and opposed by
another, which is a little larger. The enemy house is about to attack them
because it believes the allies are too strong. The characters know their
allies are actually a lot weaker. If they betray their allies, they can attack
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
241
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
the enemies while they are distracted, but if they keep their allies’ secret,
they must face a stronger force alone, which guarantees death and destruction at their homes even if they can fend off the attack. Of course,
if they mess up the betrayal, they could end up facing both their former
enemies and former allies at once.
The third step comes in linking adventures. The problems with a victory should never just be simple tragedies. Rather, they should set up
and help to drive future adventures in the campaign. The books do include simple random tragedies, but players are generally more forgiving
if you avoid meaningless disaster. It is particularly good if the problem
with the victory is something that someone, whether the player characters or their opponents, can seek vengeance for.
ChILDrEN
Although A Song of Ice and Fire is not aimed at children, a significant
number of the viewpoint characters are children or adolescents. This
means that young player characters would be highly appropriate to the
feel of the books. However, you should think very, very carefully before
going down this route.
First, children are hard for adults to portray accurately. Martin has
admitted Bran’s chapters are the hardest of the books to write because
of the need to take an eight-year-old’s point of view. He has the chance
to write and rewrite, which is denied people in a roleplaying game.
There is no way around this; you simply have to judge whether you are
up to the challenge.
Second, children get no special treatment. Vengeance, betrayal, cruelty, and sex all target the young characters as much as the older ones.
Many people would be very uncomfortable with playing in a game in
which children were explicitly tortured or engaged in sex, even if the
graphic details were omitted. If any members of your group could not
cope with a thirteen-year-old enjoying a consensual sexual relationship,
or a ten-year-old being kidnapped and beaten, then you should avoid
young player characters.
Third, children have no history. A ten-year-old just has not lived long
enough to establish links to many people, making it harder to tie them
into the campaign. In this case, there are ways around it. Children have
parents and siblings, and those ties can be used to link them to other
peoples’ secrets, at least. The practice of fosterage can create broader
links and rivalries from a very early age. If you are happy with the first
two problems, then some thought can minimize the impact of this one.
However, it will be difficult to do this if more than one of the player
characters (two if you have a large group) are young.
None of these problems are insurmountable, and they are all easier
for characters Jon Snow’s age (fourteen) or older. However, you do need
to think about how you are going to handle them before allowing young
player characters into your game.
On the upside, A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying is designed to
accommodate younger characters with the Destiny system. Children
have more Destiny Points because of their greater unformed potential, which they can use to help survive the challenges adults use their
superior experience and abilities to overcome. Certainly some of the
child characters of the novels manage to survive against all odds,
moving towards their own destinies. Young characters in your own
chronicle can do the same.
Changing the Plot
There is a problem with running RPGs based on novels (or films)
that needs to be confronted head-on. What if the player characters do
something that derails the plot of the novels? They are then no longer
playing in the world of the novels because some of the most important
events are not happening. In some ways, Westeros is more forgiving
than many worlds in this respect. The Seven Kingdoms are, it soon
becomes obvious, rotten to the core and just waiting for some spark to
tip them into civil war. There is nothing the characters can realistically
do to prevent that war from happening, and if the war happens, the
factions are going to fall in a way resembling those in the novels. In
addition, there is no one central task that defines the world that, to be
faithful to the novels, has to be performed by an NPC; no ring that
needs dropped into a volcano. So you can have the player characters
do things without making them feel like bit players, and without completely derailing the novels.
In other ways, however, Westeros is a lot less forgiving. There are very
few corners where interactions with the nobility do not risk changing
things so the events portrayed in the novels could not realistically happen as described. True, if you set the campaign in Dorne, you’re fine until the events of A Storm of Swords, but then Dorne becomes a significant
setting for the novels as well, and you have to deal with it.
This problem is intensified by the need to have the player characters
interact with central characters from the novels. At the very least, important characters from the books are going to have allies and enemies
who do not feature in the official storyline.
The most important part of tackling this problem is to recognize in advance that it exists and to decide, as a group, how you want to handle it.
The group may decide that they just want to play in the world of A
Song of Ice and Fire. In fact, they’d quite like to play in a campaign where
they try to prevent the civil war, perhaps by having a player character
succeed Jon Arryn as the Hand of the King, thus leaving Ned Stark in
the North. In this case, you do not have a problem. The players want everything to turn out differently, so even if they almost certainly cannot
stop the war, they are not going to be upset if the war plays out in a very
different way from the original version.
However, your group may also want to play through the events of
the novels. This is entirely reasonable; there are some very dramatic moments in the books, and the desire to play a character who is there is
understandable. There are a number of possible approaches to this. The
easiest is to start the campaign just before that event. That is, run time
forward from the default starting date, and begin your campaign during
the war. The player characters might not begin with a close relationship
to any of the main novel characters, but they have an ideal chance to
finish that way.
Still, having mentioned the easy ways out, it is best to consider the
hardest case because it is also a perfectly sensible way to play the game,
and the techniques useful in it can also be used in easier cases. The hardest case is one in which the characters start some time before war breaks
out, want to interact with characters from the novels, and still want to
participate in many of the events in the novels.
It is important to realize it is impossible to have the events play out
exactly as they do in the novels. Apart from anything else, if the player
242
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
characters are involved, and not merely spectators, they must be able to
have an impact on the course of events, so even if the final result is the
same as in the books, the chain of events getting there will be different.
The best you can aim for is having a recognizable event play out with
some differences.
First, you and the players must recognize there are some characters
who cannot die before the novels start. Some characters cannot be replaced and still have things go on as before. If Cersei is assassinated, no
one can take her place, not even if Robert remarries. However, not all
significant characters fall into this group. Old Walder Frey plays a very
important role, but the role could be played by his heir. Even some of
the viewpoint characters are replaceable, with only minor differences to
their role in the story.
This should be reflected in your planning for adventures. The player
characters are unlikely to wake up one morning and suddenly decide to
assassinate the queen unless the adventure leads in that direction. So you
should not design adventures that lead in that direction. Rivalries with
characters who must survive should not be life-or-death rivalries; they
should be political, at worst. The books can survive the player characters
making nasty remarks about Cersei in private, after all. The best way to
manage this is to pick a central life-or-death rival who can die and keep
other characters peripheral. Doing so does not require you to divide the
whole cast into “dispensable” and “indispensable,” merely to find one or
two characters in the former category. A similar consideration applies to
allies of the characters; if the ally can be drawn into danger, make sure
that they are replaceable.
Another issue concerns the characters’ allies. If you play a political game, the characters might, by the time the novels start, be very
strong candidates for the position of the Hand of the King. Robert
will still go to his old friend Ned first, but the existence of the characters’ faction will change the balance of the subsequent politics quite
substantially. Again, the solution is to keep the campaign away from
the center. If the characters have risen to be the most influential bannermen of the Starks, things will shift but only slightly. The characters
are likely to be sent into a number of the events of the novels, which
is all to the good, but they will not be able to change whether most
events happen.
As mentioned above, secrets are a major feature of the novels. Player
characters who learn those secrets early could cause problems for the
plot. Again, you can design adventures that are not likely to uncover
those secrets. However, in this case, you can plan adventures that let
the characters uncover the secret, but leave them in no position to do
anything about it. They do not have enough evidence or political support to bring it into the open. Once the war starts, such a predicament
is likely to make them very useful to one or more factions, however,
so it should be handled with caution. They can also tell their allies
what they know, and their allies will take them seriously, so if your
characters are friendly with Tyrion, it is probably best for them not to
learn certain secrets.
To summarize, then, you should design the whole campaign so the
sensible outcomes do not derail the plot of the books. Since we are
assuming this is what the players also want, they will play along. If it
is entirely realistic for their characters not to cause trouble, they won’t
go out of their way to spoil things. This method involves setting events
on the periphery of politics, whether geographical or social. Intrigues
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
243
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
among minor courtiers in King’s Landing are just as far from changing things as power struggles in the riverlands. Choose a primary who
can be defeated without causing problems and close allies who can
safely die. If a character needs to be protected, make the connection
more distant.
Finally, in many cases, you have considerable discretion in deciding
on the wider impact of the characters’ acts. If you want to preserve the
plot of the novels, you can choose an impact that supports the novels.
While the Boltons of the Dreadfort could abandon the Starks in response to the rise of other bannermen, they are not forced to, and if
you want to preserve the events of the novels, they had better not. If the
players want you to keep the plot on track, then writing adventures to
avoid events that would obviously derail it will make them more forgiving if their actions do not happen to have possible consequences that
would cause problems.
Stories &
Chronicles
This section gives you some concrete ideas for stories and chronicles
set in Westeros. They are only ideas, not ready-to-run, and thus, they
serve in large part as examples of how to implement the general ideas
given above.
Story hooKS
These suggestions are primarily aimed at single stories, but some could
also be expanded into chronicles.
Court
The characters are sent to King’s Landing on a very specific mission—
they need to get a particular concession from the king, something not
inherently difficult to obtain if they can get a proper hearing from the
king himself. However, other courtiers, particularly rivals of the characters, know seeing the king almost guarantees success, so they do their
best to keep the characters running in circles and away from the throne.
DIPLomaCy
The characters’ liege sends them, and another of his bannermen, to negotiate a relatively minor issue with a major lord. The other lord wants
to handle the matter personally, but it is not important enough to
justify two great lords meeting, so he has agreed to deal with ambassadors. The negotiations should be fairly easy; several solutions would
be acceptable to both sides. The problem is the other bannerman has a
past entanglement with the player characters and is interested in making them look foolish. If the negotiations failed, and it looked like the
player characters’ fault, he would be pleased. He is trying to feed them
false information and get them involved in compromising activities.
If he can convince them the great lord is plotting to kill them, that
would be ideal.
FEaSt
The characters attend a feast with many courses and dancing. They are
required to be polite to the people around them. One takes an immediate romantic interest in a player character, an interest of which his or her
family would not approve. Another wants to goad the characters into
insulting him, so he can demand a duel (to first blood, he isn’t interested
in potentially dying), and make them look foolish. Still another drinks
too much and makes comments that could cause a lot of trouble if the
characters do not smooth things over. The characters can make friends
or enemies over the course of a single day, and everything they do is
very public.
KIDNaP
One of the characters has developed a romantic relationship with a
Narrator character, but marriage is impossible, most likely because of
prior arrangements but also, perhaps, because of the hostility between
their families. The characters decide (if necessary, under prompting
from the Narrator character) they have to be together, and the woman
runs away to join the man. The woman’s family treats this as kidnap. If
the player character is the woman, the other player characters have to
resolve the situation without denying it is kidnap because their family would be greatly shamed. If the player character is the man, all the
player characters have to deal with the “rescuers.” The couple does not
want to be broken up, so just handing the woman over is not really an
option. This is something of a no-win situation; success means avoiding
things going horribly wrong.
marrIaGE
The characters have to negotiate a marriage alliance, either for themselves or for a close relative. There are a number of sensible candidates
from other noble families, but none are perfect. Ideally, the character to
be married should have a lover, consummated or not, who would be a
politically difficult choice as a partner. The characters must be very tactful in their negotiations because breaking off a marriage after one side
thinks it is arranged is a grave insult and can make long-lasting enemies.
There is no right ending to this adventure. The characters just choose
which groups to turn into allies, and which to turn into enemies and, of
course, whether to make the person at the center of events happy or not.
PoISoN
The characters host some visitors and provide a feast. One of the visitors
collapses and dies of poison. The hosts are the obvious suspects and must
find the real criminal and solid evidence to avoid facing a lasting enmity.
The amount of time they have to do this, and the strength of evidence
they need, depends on their previous relationship with the guests; it is
easier to convince friends of your innocence. On the other hand, the
characters have a lot more to lose if the victims were previously friendly.
The poisoner could be an enemy of the guests who just decided to implicate the player characters, another member of the visiting family, or
an enemy of the characters trying to blacken their reputation.
244
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
ra
IDErS
Wildlings from beyond the Wall or ironmen from the Iron Islands arrive in the characters’ lands, raiding and burning villages. The characters
must catch and defeat them before they can get away with their booty.
This requires swift and decisive action, and the characters cannot assemble overwhelming force quickly enough. They must plan well and
are likely to lose a number of loyal retainers even if they succeed.
SErvaNt
A new servant is hired at the characters’ home. She is the sister of a
raider who was killed in a previous adventure and is here to get revenge.
She is not a skilled plotter, but she is not stupid, and she tries to stage
accidents, in the hope of eventually burning the whole castle down. If
there is enough of a distraction, she tries to kill the character who killed
her brother with a hidden dagger.
tourNamENt
The characters attend a tournament and participate. Their main rival
arrives, but soon after he withdraws from all the events on grounds
of illness. He stays in his pavilion, and the story is he hopes to be able
to participate before the end. In reality, he wants to see the characters
humiliated, and he devotes his efforts to sabotaging their chances. The
fact he is not participating makes it harder to demonstrate that he is
cheating and gives him much more time in which to do so.
war
The characters go to war, in a fairly small way. They might be sending
an expedition to support the Night’s Watch against the wildlings, or
tensions with another noble family might have finally got out of hand.
In the latter case, both sides need to fight it out without bringing the
attention of their lords down on them. So the actual war cannot go
beyond a single battle, after which they will publicly apologize and
make “peace,” with one side in a stronger position. The biggest problem for the characters is one of their allies plans to sell them out. They
might be able to find the traitor early, in which case they might just
be relatively weak in the battle, or they might have to deal with him
changing sides once battle has been joined, putting them in a very
dangerous position.
ChroNICLES
While the previous section concerned single stories, this section deals
with concepts for whole chronicles—groups of related stories. They
are designed to happen in the period before the events of the books
get started, so the background is one of relative peace across the Seven
Kingdoms. The scope of the campaigns is also finite, so you can finish
them before the books get going. Following that plan allows the players
to get comfortable with their characters and get the characters established in Westeros before they get involved in the great events of the
novels. Thus, the campaigns are also designed to not disrupt the plot of
the novels excessively.
rECLaImING thE BIrthrIGht
The characters have been deprived of their birthright by another minor house, and they must fight to get it back. The birthright in question must be something of great importance, and the obvious candidate is land. The other house has claimed the ancestral seat of the
player characters’ family and pushed the player characters onto a small
fraction of their former territory. However, the characters could have
retained most of their land, or even expanded in area, but lost control
of a castle with great historical importance. The lost birthright could
also be an inherited item, but it would have to be something like a
sword of Valyrian steel.
It is probably best if the player characters were deprived of the birthright fairly. If they have lost a lot of land, a recent ancestor might have
been a criminal and lost the lands as just punishment. Alternatively,
he might have been spendthrift and sold it. An item or single holding
might have been transferred as part of a marriage allowance the characters now regret, making the characters’ position morally ambiguous.
On the other hand, there should be some problem with the transfer, or
the characters seem like clear villains. A real-world example: the Elgin
marbles were taken from the Parthenon and exported to England with
the permission of the government of Greece at the time. However, at
that point, Greece was ruled by the Turks. Thus, both the Greeks and
the English can claim to be the rightful owners.
The conflict cannot be solved through simple violence because the
initial legal situation is against the player characters. Even if they can
take their birthright by force, other nobles will compel them to give it
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
245
Chapter.14:.EXPLORING.WESTEROS
back, and they may lose what little they have left (if not actually losing
their lives). This predicament is obvious to the characters and should be
made clear to the players.
The campaign relies on the player characters taking the initiative—
the people who hold their birthright are happy with the status quo,
after all. They can undermine the rivals’ hold on their birthright in a
number of ways. They can pursue legal channels, which could involve
bribery, intimidation, and the improvement of evidence. They can undermine the rivals’ position, making them look like traitors, weakening
them through raids blamed on someone else, or faking evidence that
makes them look like aggressors. They can also try simply provoking
their rivals into starting a war, so that the characters might be allowed
to keep any gains.
No matter how things are set up, the final contest is almost certain to
be military, as the rivals will not give up something so valuable without
a fight.
a FathEr’S BLESSING
The player characters are all siblings, and their father is the lord. However, he thinks the player characters are all unreliable failures, and he
puts all his hopes and trust in their brother. Their brother is a nasty
piece of work, though their father does not see it; the brother is too
clever to present his father with incontrovertible evidence. Some of the
player characters’ failures may be genuine, but others may have been
constructed by their scheming brother.
The player characters are at risk of being disinherited, so they must
expose their brother for the villain that he is and convince their father
that they are trustworthy. The brother, meanwhile, is using his influence to make life difficult for them while feigning love and support
in front of father. If the characters move openly against their brother,
they will look the treacherous ones. On the other hand, if the player
characters cannot do something to convince their father that they are
competent, they are unlikely to benefit even if they do unmask their
brother.
This campaign is inherently tangled because the main rival is part
of the family. An added complication is the fact that only one player
character can be made the heir, which might divide the player characters if they come close to success. However, you can affect the tone
by changing the character of the brother. At one extreme, he might
be a bastard, barely known to the characters’ father—and thoroughly
evil and treacherous. This puts the player characters in the right. At
the other extreme, he might just be very ambitious, dislike the player
characters because they used to pick on him, and not have lied about
any of their mistakes; he just put the worst possible light on things.
In this case, the player characters might even be able to reconcile with
their brother, though the events of the campaign are likely to make
that difficult.
A good way to end this campaign is for the characters’ father to die,
and the heir take over the holding. If the heir is the brother, the player
characters are out on their ears, just in time to get involved in a war. If
the heir is a player character, he becomes a bannerman, just in time to
get involved in a war.
wILDLINGS
This campaign concept is a simple one. The characters hold land in the
North, near the Wall, and suffer from wildling raids. Adventures would
involve fighting off raiders, tracking them back across the Wall, trying
to destroy their encampments, and possibly stumbling on to the scale
of Mance Rayder’s plans. The characters are closely involved with the
Night’s Watch, but even though they are on the same side, relations are
tense, for they are also using the same resources. The characters may also
encounter wights and the Others, as long as they do not have clear proof
or lots of witnesses. As long as wights and monsters beyond the Wall
can be dismissed as stories, the plot of the novels can unfold.
Since the characters are in the North, they are bannermen to the
Starks. Their problems with wildlings keep them away from Winterfell
most of the time, but building a good relationship with Eddard Stark,
and possibly with his children, would set them up for involvement in
the coming great events. As Eddard takes his responsibilities seriously,
he might well come in person to help the characters against a particularly large raiding band, and Benjen Stark, as First Ranger, would also
be expected to have some contact with them.
As long as the player characters are not able to kill Mance Rayder, or
other named wildlings, this campaign is unlikely to disrupt the books.
There are numerous wildlings north of the Wall, after all.
BLooD For BLooD
The characters’ home did not fare well in one of the recent wars. The
castle was sacked and largely destroyed, family members were killed and
possibly raped, and the smallfolk pillaged. The characters were on the
winning side, however, so they got their lands back, in ruins. But the
people responsible for sacking it were not punished nearly so severely.
They continue to enjoy the prosperity of their lands and holding.
This campaign is about vengeance. The characters, at least to start
with, want to see their enemies dead and their castle cast down. The
problem is the king, and most of the high nobles, want the last war to be
over, and do not look kindly on families who stir up trouble again. Thus,
the player characters must rely on schemes that hide their involvement,
or that trap their enemies into offending enough people that they can
be attacked with impunity. In the classic style, the characters do not
want their enemies to perish at anyone else’s hands, so they aim simply
to keep everyone else out of the argument.
To complicate matters, have a significant member of the enemy family be genuinely repentant, making efforts to compensate the player
characters and rebuild good relations. Of course, he (or she) is not willing to sell his own family out, but he is willing to make real sacrifices
because he thinks his family really was wrong. The player characters will
doubtless assume some devious plot. To make things complex in a different way, it could actually be a devious plot.
The campaign ends with either successful vengeance or, much less
probably, with peace between the families. Vengeance begets vengeance,
of course, and the characters’ enemies will have the advantage that the
outbreak of civil war allows them to act much more directly.
